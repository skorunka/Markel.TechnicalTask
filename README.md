# Market Technical Task

Universal Insurance has decided to enter the car insurance market and require a rating engine to quote for business. The initial calculation that Universal want to implement is as follows:
	
  Premium = Base premium for vehicle type * Factor for vehicle manufacturer

  Vehicle Type	Base Premium
  Car	£800
  Van	£1000
 
  Vehicle manufacturer	Factor
  Audi	1.5
  Mercedes	2.0

## Example 1.

  Input: Insurance required for Audi Car
  Output: Premium = £1200 

## Example 2.
 
  Input: Mercedes Van 
  Output: Premium = £2000

Please write some C# code to implement these requirements for Universal Insurance’s rating engine.
